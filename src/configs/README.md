## GNN Configs

Here is where GNN configs should be stored.

Be careful to change the options 'log_dir', 'signal_dataset', and 'bkg_dataset' to reflect the correct directory/file names.

Under 'model', the value for 'endcap' should be changed to choose which endcap will be trained on.
- 1: Positive Endcap
- -1: Negative Endcap
